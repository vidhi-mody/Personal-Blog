I would like to start this blog with one of the stories shared on the WaterCooler by James. (*Read more about 'WaterCooler' in my previous [blog.](https://vidhi-mody.github.io/blogs/2020/05/gsocpedia-chapter-two/)*) \
Early in his career he worked in an aviation company in UK. The project was related to the network connectivity of the airplane during it's entire journey. The code was written. The code was tested by flying the plane through UK. Everything seemed to be working fine. Now the interesting part, during an international journey the network connection was working just fine uptil it suddenly disconnected completely. When the flight landed, the development team was called to figure out what went wrong. Turns out the flight passed through the equator (lattitude: 0) leading to the divide by zero error! :scream: \
*Moral: The importance of testing is real* :sparkles: 

#### Week 4 and 5 

The Coding period begins! I really think it was a great idea to begin early. The community bonding period gave a great start to my project. I had my local environment set up, the workflow for my project was finalized and I made great progress towards my project completion too! I have meetings with my mentor Željko four times a week and I can't be more grateful to him for sparing so much of his time mentoring me.

The strategy I will be following is to upgrade smaller and "easier" repos first and as I gain experience and progress in my project I will take up the more difficult ones! Things are going quite well so far :smiley:

**Highlights:**
> - Completed implemenation in the [ElectronPdfService repository](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T250179)
> - Completed implemenation in the [GrowthExperiments repository](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T244763)
> - Completed implemenation in the [Math repository](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T253791)
> - Completed implemenation in the [RelatedArticles repository](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T250685)
> - Completed implemenation in the [wikidata/query/gui repository](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T250685)

Since the coding period began I've faced quite a few errors here and there but so far all is well. Let's see what the coming weeks have in store for me. See you in two weeks! :beers:
