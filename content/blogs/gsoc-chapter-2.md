It's been less than a month but this community has really grown on me. The past few weeks have been really eventful. A huge shoutout to my mentor, [Željko](https://filipin.eu) for giving me the best on-boarding experience ever! (:mega: You can checkout his blog on GSoC [here](https://filipin.eu/gsoc-2020).) In this short span, I got to meet the entire QTE & Release Engineering team. I also gained a new sense of professionalism and a clearer view of what it meant to be working as a community! :purple_heart:

#### Week 3 and 4 (19th-1st June)
Of all the past and upcoming weeks, this one is always going to be my favourite. I had my first commits merged. :tada:

I faced a few problems upgrading this repo including a database error in setting up the enivornment for this repo locally. A suggested solution was to delete the existing container and create a new one since it is way easier than finding the problem in the existing one! \
*"Treat containers like cattle not pets."* \

By far the greatest analogy I've ever heard! :grimacing:

-----(*Enters the WaterCooler* :potable_water:)----- \
> A little more context, a WaterCooler is a meet wherein the team gathers to just talk about things other than work. A great initiative to learn more about each other and take some time off work. I really enjoyed it! \
The Analogy: At a workplace, sometimes when you head out to get a glass of water, you might run into a co-worker and y'all catch-up with each other's life. The WaterCooler meet aims to do just that.

The coding period is officially going to begin! I'm really looking forward to working on the advanced repositories, hopefully it goes well. :information_desk_person: \
See you in two weeks! :beers:
